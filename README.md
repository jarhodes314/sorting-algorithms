# Sorting Algorithms

This is a submodule for my main project, [sorting-visualiser](https://github.com/jarhodes314/sorting-visualiser).

It will implement a variety of algorithms. One is Fisher-Yates shuffle (already implemented) and the rest are all comparison-based sorting algorithms (apart from Bogosort).

## Implemented
* Fisher-Yates shuffle
* Bubble sort

## Planned to implement
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Shell sort
* Timsort
* Heapsort
* Quicksort
* Mergesort
* Bogosort
* [Slowsort](http://wiki.c2.com/?SlowSort)
